# 🐍 Python Portfolio Projects

Welcome to my collection of Python Portfolio Projects! 🎉 In this repository, you'll find exciting projects showcasing my Python programming skills. These projects cover various domains, from data analysis to web scraping, and serve multiple purposes. 🚀

## 🗂️ Project List

### 1. 🏦 Bank Loan Risk Assessment: Managing Risk in Lending

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a banking dataset to identify patterns and driving factors behind loan defaults. The goal is to understand the variables that are strong indicators of default, which can be used for risk assessment and portfolio management.

### 2. 🕷️ WebScraperAIAgent

This Streamlit app allows you to scrape any websites using an AI agent. You can provide a URL and specify what information you want the AI agent to extract from the website. It's like having your own personal web detective! 🕵️‍♀️
