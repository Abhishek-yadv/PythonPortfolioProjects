## üêç Python Portfolio Projects

Welcome to my collection of PythonPortfolioProjects! In this repository, you'll find some projects
showcasing my Python programming skills. Techniques that are used in these projects can also cover other domains 
from data analysis and web scraping to automation and various purposes.

## Project List

1. Bank Loan Risk Assessment: Managing Risk in Lending. This project involves performing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a banking dataset to identify patterns and driving factors
behind loan defaults. The goal is to understand the variables that are strong indicators of default,
which can be used for risk assessment and portfolio management.

2. WebScraperAIAgent: This Streamlit app allows you to scrape websites using an AI agent.
You can provide a URL and specify what information you want the AI agent to extract from the website.

## Getting Started
To get started with any of these projects, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Abhishek-yadv/PythonPortfolioProjects.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory you're interested in.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if a `requirements.txt` file is present).
4. Follow the project-specific instructions provided in the respective project's README file or documentation.
